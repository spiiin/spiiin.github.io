## Aleksandr Boyko's Blog and Personal Page

Welcome to the blog and personal space of Aleksandr Boyko, primarily focused on programming and related topics. I am a native Russian speaker.

## Professional Background

I began my career at 2008, at the beginning of the second wave of ex-USSR gamedev(["industrion in the dark"](https://spiiin.github.io/blog/2786387393/)), and create games for iPhone/iPad platform almost from the very beginning. My work includes several published shareware games for Windows and numerous iOS/Android games. These were developed using a proprietary engine, adapted from a cross-platform engine designed for Windows and next-gen consoles, and I was part of a small team. Some of my personal story after [10 years in gamedev](https://spiiin.github.io/blog/3652741154/)(in Russian).

After a decade in game development, I transitioned to `MyTona`, where I led as a senior developer and technical producer. My passion for creating and playing games continues to drive my career.

I am doing:
**`- Profiling and optimizations`**
**`- Middleware for games`**
**`- Visual effects`**
**`- Adapting game engines for various platforms`**
**`- Engine improvements`**
**`- 3D animation pipeline and in-game rendering`**

As a team lead, my role extends beyond technical tasks to include:
**`- Improving working pipelines`**
**`- Team management`**
**`- Exploring ideas and technologies`**
**`- Watching for game-dev industry`**
**`- Working as honest programmer`** -- {% post_link 210816-honest-programmer-manifest 'Honest programmer manifest' %}

Also, my hobbies are:
